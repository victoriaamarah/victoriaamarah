## About Me

Hi, I'm Victoria 👋
I'm an aspiring Data Engineer building production-ready data pipelines.

Currently working on:
- ETL pipelines with comprehensive data validation
- Multi-source data ingestion patterns
- SQL projects for data warehousing

I recently built a **customer order processing pipeline** featuring incremental loading, data quality checks, and SQLite integration.

I'm learning **cloud data engineering** and **workflow orchestration** while building my portfolio.
